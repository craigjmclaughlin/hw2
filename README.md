Homework Assignment 2
I adhere to the honor pledge, all work provided = my own

Using CLI: To use this CLI, input a command followed by the desired parameters, as specified. When inputting file names
use the complete path.

Using TIFF: Commands work as specified in the assignment. tiffWrite creates a new file in the project as long as
a file does not already exist with that name. When inputting file name for tiff commands, ensure that it
ends with ".tif", this is not done automatically.

Information: All methods used for this assigment are declared in Tiff.h and implemented in Tiff.cpp. When
tiffStat is called, it does not store any of the tiff file's data- it merely outputs it. When tiffRead is called,
the data is stored in static tiff class variables, which tiffStat accesses.

Documentation: Method documentation is provided in the CLI.h file and Tiff.h file.
