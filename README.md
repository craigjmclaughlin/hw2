Using CLI: To use this CLI, input a command followed by the desired parameters, as specified. When inputting file names
use the complete path.

Using TIFF:

Information: All methods used for this assigment are declared in CLI.h and implemented in CLI.cpp. CLI_ProcessLine()
processes each line, calling the required module methods (such as read() and draw()) as necessary. CLI_ProcessLine()
and CLI_Read() can call each other, infinite recursion is avoided by passing the file stack back and forth and not
permitting more than 5 files to be processed at once. The main_loop() method simply calls the CLI_ProcessLine()
method.

Documentation: Method documentation is provided in the CLI.h file and Tiff.h file.
